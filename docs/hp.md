# How to get HP warranty information


There's no official API for HP warranty like Dell's. 
This leverages a proxied service api.warrantywatcher.com to query HP serial numbers

For now, you can use the following key to access the service:

`bza98Nyy7PHVNjDwZKeTRqapvu8EViStXNrQUch-M6I`

Set it under on the configure page.
